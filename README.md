### As a student, I am quite busy on weekdays. However, at weekends, I have much free time, so I usually spend it on relaxing to prepare for a coming busy week. First of all, in my free time, I like playing some sports, such as soccer, badminton or basketball, with my friends. Sport not only makes me stronger but also connects me with my friends who have the same hobbies. We sometimes go riding in order that we can combine sporting activity and sightseeing. If the weather is not fine enough for me to hang out with my friends, I like to read books. I have a big bookshelf with many kinds of books but I prefer science books. Through these books, my knowledge is gradually enlarged.
